## Prerequisites

- [ ] Equinix account with Fabric access
- [ ] Claude Desktop installed
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed
- [ ] 5 minutes of your time

## Step 1: Get Your API Token (2 minutes)

1. Go to [Equinix Fabric Portal](https://fabric.equinix.com)
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Click on your profile ‚Üí **User Settings**

```

**That's it!** The server is now installed globally.

## Step 3: Configure Claude Desktop (2 minutes)

### Find your config file:

**macOS**: 
```bash
open ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/
```

**Windows**: 
```powershell
explorer %APPDATA%\Claude
```

### Edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:

If the file doesn't exist, create it. Then add:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "equinix-fabric": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "equinix-fabric-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "EQUINIX_API_TOKEN": "paste-your-token-here"
      }

Completely quit and reopen Claude Desktop for changes to take effect.

## Step 5: Test It! (30 seconds)

Open Claude Desktop and try these commands:

### Test 1: List Your Ports
```
List all my Fabric ports
```

You should see a list of your ports with details!

### Test 2: Check Connections
```
Show me all my active connections
```

### Test 3: View Metro Locations
```
What metro locations are available?
```

## üéâ Success!

If you see results, you're all set! You can now manage Equinix Fabric using natural language.

## What Can You Do Now?

Try asking Claude:

- **"List all my Fabric resources"** - Get an overview
- **"Create a connection from Singapore to Hong Kong"** - Set up connectivity
- **"Show me my bandwidth usage"** - Monitor performance
- **"Create a cloud router in London"** - Deploy infrastructure
- **"What service profiles are available for AWS?"** - Explore cloud connections

## Common First Steps

### 1. Explore Your Infrastructure
```
Give me a summary of all my Fabric resources - ports, connections, and routers
```

### 2. Create Your First Connection
```
I want to create a 500 Mbps connection between my Singapore port and AWS. Walk me through it.
```

### 3. Set Up Multi-Cloud
```
Help me set up a cloud router in Tokyo that connects to AWS, Azure, and GCP
```

### 4. Monitor Usage
```
Show me bandwidth statistics for all my connections and identify any underutilized ones
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Loading?

1. **Check Claude Desktop logs**
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\`

2. **Verify Node.js is installed**
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   Should show v18.x or higher

3. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   npm list -g equinix-fabric-mcp
   ```

4. **Check config file syntax**
   - Ensure valid JSON (no trailing commas!)
   - Token is in quotes
   - All brackets match

### API Errors?

- **401 Unauthorized**: Double-check your API token
- **403 Forbidden**: Verify your account has Fabric API access
- **Rate Limited**: Wait a minute and try again
